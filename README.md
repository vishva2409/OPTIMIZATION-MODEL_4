## **Abstract**

This project demonstrates the application of Linear Programming (LP) to solve a production planning problem for a manufacturing company. The company produces two products, each requiring processing time on two different machines with limited available hours. The objective is to determine the optimal production quantity for each product to maximize weekly profit. 

The project utilizes the PuLP library in Python to formulate and solve the LP problem. The notebook outlines the problem setup, defines decision variables, formulates the objective function and constraints, and solves the model to obtain the optimal production plan and maximum profit. 

Furthermore, the project provides insights into the resource utilization and potential areas for improvement in the production process. This example highlights the effectiveness of LP in optimizing business operations and making data-driven decisions.

**Key Deliverable:**

* **Jupyter Notebook:** A comprehensive notebook containing the Python code, problem description, solution, and insights.

This project provides a foundational understanding of LP and its practical applications in business contexts. It can be extended to more complex scenarios involving multiple products, resources, and constraints, enabling businesses to make informed decisions and improve their overall efficiency and profitability.
